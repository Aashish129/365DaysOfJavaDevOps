# 365DaysOfJavaDevOps

Welcome to my journey of mastering Java and DevOps by building 365 projects in 365 days! This repository is designed to help me and others learn Java from scratch and integrate it with essential DevOps practices and tools.

## üöÄ About the Journey

This repository is a collection of daily projects that range from beginner-level Java programs to advanced DevOps integrations using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and more. The goal is to bridge the gap between development and operations, making me a well-rounded DevOps engineer.

### üìÖ Project Phases

1. **Phase 1: Java Fundamentals (Days 1-60)**
   - Focus on learning Java syntax, object-oriented programming, and core concepts.
   - Projects include basic console applications, data structures, and algorithms.

2. **Phase 2: Intermediate Java and DevOps Concepts (Days 61-120)**
   - Start integrating Java with DevOps tools like Docker, Jenkins, Spring Boot, and REST APIs.
   - Learn how to build CI/CD pipelines, containerize applications, and deploy them.

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Java and DevOps Practices (Days 121-365)**
   - Dive deep into microservices, Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, monitoring, and security practices.
   - Build complex Java-based applications that are production-ready and scalable.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

- Each project is organized into its own folder named as `DayXX-ProjectName` (e.g., `Day01-HelloWorld`).
- Each folder contains:
  - **Java source files** (`.java`) or other relevant files.
  - **README.md** for project-specific instructions, setup, and usage.
  - **Resources** such as Dockerfiles, YAML configurations, etc., if applicable.

### üí° Getting Started

To run any Java project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/365DaysOfJavaDevOps.git
   cd 365DaysOfJavaDevOps
